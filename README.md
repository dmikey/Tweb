Tweb
=========

Surrounded in a world full of Twitter clients, Tweb hopes to add yet one more.
Tweb is chasing familar ground. Utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript, it can 
eventually be deployed and built for almost any OS with a container.

Tweb is built on Enyo 2, and jsOauth. There are no plans to add any additional
libraries. 

Tweb aims to exploit the modularity and expansiveness afforded by Enyo 2.

Tweb also wants to be easy to tinker with. You should be able to easily
download source code, modify, and run the project and see instant results. 
Please check out the wiki for documentation!

Tweb comes ready to run in Google Chrome out of the box, you need only modify
initialize-sample.js, by adding your API keys, and loading Tweb as an unpacked
extension. This allows you to easily stay on the bleeding edge build.
